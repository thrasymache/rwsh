<h3>%autofunction</h3>
%autofunction searches for files in $PATH with the same name as its
argument. If one is found, then it is inserted into the executable map
with the remaining arguments as its argument script. This is a hack so
that rwsh can be usable while I get around to implementing command
substitution. There will be a much better way to do this once that is
done.<br>
<br>
<h3>%echo</h3>
The %echo command prints its arguments separated by a single space. It
does not append a newline. An echo function that prints its arguments
followed by a newline can easily be created from the %echo builtin and
the %newline builtin.<br>
<h3>%exit</h3>
%exit causes the shell to exit before the next command is requested
from the user. It does not terminate any function (i.e. commands after
%exit in a function will be run). After any enclosing functions
complete, rwsh.shutdown will be run before the shell actually
terminates.<br>
<h3>%false</h3>
%false returns 1 regardless of its arguments.<br>
<br>
<h3>%function</h3>
%function inserts its argument function into the executable map. The first argument is used as the name for the new function.<br>
<h3>%importenv</h3>
%importenv causes the environment that rwsh was run in to be imported into the variable map.<br>
<h3>%ls</h3>
As it currently stands, %ls is a very stripped-down version of the
standard ls. Selection write and read work just as well with external
commands as with built-ins, so feel free to define the function ls to
use /bin/ls rather than %ls.<br>
<h3>%newline</h3>
%newline prints a newline character<br>
<br>
<h3>%printenv</h3>
%printenv prints out the entire variable map if given no arguments. If
it is given an argument, then it prints out the value of that variable.<br>
<h3>%set</h3>
%set writes a variable to the variable map. the first argument is the
name of the variable, any additional arguments are the value of the
variable.<br>
<h3>%selection_set</h3>
%selection_set is described in the selection document. Briefly, it is a
variant of %set, that treats the current value of the variable as a
path that should be modified by the second argument.<br>
<h3>%true</h3>
%true returns 0 regardless of its arguments<br>
<br>
<h3>%which</h3>
%which prints the value stored in the executable map at the name given
in its first argument. Functions are printed by giving the command that
would create that function. Built-ins just print their name. Executable
files are added to the executable map when they are run. If an
executable file has been run, then %which will print the name of the
file, otherwise it will inform you that it is not in the executable
map, whether or not the file exists and is executable.
rwsh.mapped_argfunction and rwsh.argfunction are both recognized as
names for whatever argument function might have been passed to %which,
and are printed with just their enclosing braces.<br>
<h3>%version</h3>
%version prints out the version of rwsh that is currently running
