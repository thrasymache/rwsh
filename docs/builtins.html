<body>












Builtins take a fixed number of arguments, and will fail having set
ERRNO to ARGS if they are passed a different number.
Builtins&nbsp;either return nonzero on error or set ERRNO in the case
of other failures, rather than printing any diagnostic text. They are
not intended to regularly be useful as something to run from the
command line. Instead they are intended to be useful building blocks
for shell functions.<br>












<h3>%append_to_errno</h3>






Because of the way that ERRNO affects control flow, the one thing that
you generally want to do when there's an error (create ERRNO if it
doesn't exist, and add a new error on the end if it does), requres
several commands with the standard variable builtins. %append_to_errno
was created to fix this, and encourage good error handling. It takes
one or more&nbsp;arguments which will be the new value of ERRNO if it
did not previously exist, or which will be placed on the end if it
already has a value.
<h3>%cd</h3>











The %cd changes the current working directory to the path given as its
argument. If successful it sets CWD to the argument that was passed to
it. It returns the value returned by chdir.
<h3>%echo</h3>












The %echo command prints its arguments separated by a single space. It
does not append a newline. An echo function that prints its arguments
followed by a newline can easily be created from the %echo builtin and
the %newline builtin.<br>











<h3>%else</h3>











%else does not take any arguments, it runs its argfunction if IF_TEST
is false, and then sets IF_TEST to the empty string. It is a syntax
error for %else to occur except following %if and zero or more %else_if
or %else_if_not commands, or for a sequence of those commands to occur
without a %else.
<h3>%else_if</h3>











%else_if returns 0 immediately if IF_TEST is true. Otherwise it runs
its arguments, setting IF_TEST to true, and running any argfunction if
they return 0. It is a syntax error for %else_if to occur except
between %if and %else.<br>












<h3>%else_if_not</h3>











%else_if_not is identical to %else_if except that it sets IF_TEST to
true and runs its argfunction only if the result of running its
arguments returns nonzero.






<h3>%error_unit</h3>





%error_unit runs its argfunction with ERRNO unset. If ERRNO was
previously set, after the completion of the argfunction, the original
value of ERRNO is prepended to its current value. ERRNO is left unset
only if it was unset both before %error_unit was called, and after the
completion of the argfunction<br>





<h3>%exit</h3>












%exit causes the shell to exit before the next command is requested
from the user. It does not terminate any function (i.e. commands after
%exit in a function will be run). After any enclosing functions
complete, rwsh.shutdown will be run before the shell actually
terminates.
<h3>%for</h3>





%for runs its argfunction once for each of its arguments, passing the argument to the argfunction each time as $1.<br>





<h3>%for_each_line</h3>



%for_each_line runs its argfunction once for each line of its input, passing the line as arguments to its argfunction.
<h3>%function</h3>












%function inserts its argument function into the executable map. The first argument is used as the name for the new function.<br>












<h3>%global</h3>





%global takes two arguments, a variable name and a value. If the
variable does not exist it is added to the variable_map with the given
value, if the variable does exist, then %global returns 1 and does not
change the variable map. Variables created in this way remain set after
the termination of the enclosing function.<br>





<h3>%if</h3>











%if executes its arguments as a command, and then runs its argument
function&nbsp;if it has one and if the command returned 0. It is a
syntax error for %if to follow another %if, %else_if, or %else_if_not,
unless there is an %else between them. It is not a syntax error for %if
to have no argfunction. %if returns -1 on a syntax error, the return
value of its argfunction if it is run, and 0 otherwise. It sets IF_TEST
to true if its arguments returned 0, and to false otherwise.<br>











<h3>%if_errno</h3>









%if_errno takes no arguments. &nbsp;It runs its argument function if the variable ERRNO is set.






<h3>%if_errno_is</h3>





%if_errno_is takes one argument. Its argfunction is run if ERRNO is set to the same value as this argument.<br>





<h3>%importenv_overwrite</h3>





%importenv causes the environment that rwsh was run in to be imported
into the variable map. If a variable exists in both environments, the
external value is taken.<br>





<h3>%importenv_preserve</h3>





%importenv causes the environment that rwsh was run in to be imported
into the variable map. If a variable exists in both environments, the
internal value is taken.






<h3>%internal_errors</h3>










%internal_errors takes no arguments. It prints a list of those internal
functions which are run whether they exist or not (and will thus result
in rwsh.executable_not_found errors if they do not exist). Except for
rwsh.init they are all reporting errors themselves.
<h3>%internal_features</h3>










%internal_features takes no arguments. It prints a list of those internal functions which are run only if they exist.
<h3>%internal_vars</h3>










%internal_vars takes no arguments. It prints a list of those variables
that are written by the shell itself or affect the running of builtins.
<h3>%is_default_input</h3>




returns 1 if its input has been redirected away from the stdin of the shell
<h3>%is_default_output</h3>




returns 1 if its output has been redirected away from the stdout of the shell
<h3>%is_default_error</h3>




returns 1 if its error has been redirected away from the stdout of the shell
<h3>%ls</h3>












As it currently stands, %ls is a very stripped-down version of the
standard ls. Selection write and read work just as well with external
commands as with built-ins, so feel free to define the function ls to
use /bin/ls rather than %ls.<br>












<h3>%newline</h3>












%newline prints a newline character<br>












<br>












<h3>%nop</h3>











%nop ignores its arguments, and leaves $? unchanged<br>












<h3>%return</h3>











%return takes one argument, which it converts to an integer, and then
returns that value. It has more error conditions than any other builtin.<br>











<h3>%set</h3>












%set changes the value of a variable in the variable map. the first argument is the
name of the variable, its second and any additional arguments are the value of the
variable.<br>












<h3>%selection_set</h3>












%selection_set is described in the selection document. Briefly, it is a
variant of %set, that treats the current value of the variable as a
path that should be modified by the second argument.<br>












<h3>%stepwise</h3>







%stepwise treats its arguments as a function call, looks up this
function and interprets it with the given arguments, but rather than
running this function, it passes each statement in turn to its argument
function. &nbsp;To see what this means in practice look at test.result,
where stepwise commands are listed along with their output. Also look
at the functions "or" and "and" in rwshrc. The or function runs another
function, stopping after the first statement that succeeds. &nbsp;The
and function runs another function, stopping after the first statement
that fails. &nbsp;This is equivalent to rewriting a function in another
shell replacing each ";" with "||", and "&amp;&amp;" respectively.
<h3>%source</h3>











%source attempts to run its first argument as a shell script. The
remaining arguments are passed to that shell script as its arguments.
Before the script is run, rwsh.before_script is run with the same
arguments as the script and after the script completes
rwsh.after_script is run with the same arguments again. The script is
run with all of the internal functions that apply to the command line.
(this will change in a future version.) %source returns the value
returned by the script it ran.
<h3>%test_equal</h3>





%test_equal takes two arguments. It returns 0 if those two arguments
are the same string. It returns 1 if those two arguments are different
strings.

<h3>%test_not_empty</h3>











%test_not_empty takes one argument. It returns 0 if that argument is not the empty string.
<h3>%test_not_equal</h3>





%test_not_equal takes two arguments. It returns 0 if those two
arguments are different strings. It returns 1 if those two arguments
are the same string.<br>





<h3>%unset</h3>





%unset takes one argument, the name of a variable to remove from the variable map.
<h3>%waiting_for_binary</h3>
%waiting_for_binary prints the total amount of time that the shell has
spent waiting for other processes that it has forked to terminate.
<h3>%waiting_for_shell</h3>
%waiting_for_shell prints the amount of time since
startup that the shell has not been waiting for input from the user, or
waiting for a binary to terminate, so that the sum of the three will
exactly equal the wall time elapsed since startup. If it matters, all
of the timing calculations are included within %waiting_for_shell




<h3>%waiting_for_user</h3>
%waiting_for_user prints the total amount of time that the shell has spent waiting for commands to be entered.
<h3>%which_executable</h3>












%which_executable prints the value stored in the executable map at the name given
in its first argument. Functions are printed by giving the command that
would create that function. Built-ins just print their name. Executable
files are added to the executable map when they are run. If an
executable file has been run, then %which will print the name of the
file, otherwise it will inform you that it is not in the executable
map, whether or not the file exists and is executable.
rwsh.mapped_argfunction and rwsh.argfunction are both recognized as
names for whatever argument function might have been passed to %which,
and are printed with just their enclosing braces.<br>





<br>





<h3>%which_execution_count</h3>


%which_execution_count prints the number of times that the executable
specified by its first argument has been run. It returns 1 if the
executable does not exist in the executable map.<br>





<br>





<h3>%which_last_execution_time</h3>

%which_last_execution_time prints the amount of time that&nbsp;the
executable
specified by its first argument took to run the last time it was run.
This is wall time as opposed to time that the shell was active. It
returns 1 if the
executable does not exist in the executable map.<br>





<br>





<h3>%which_total_execution_time</h3>


%which_total_execution_time prints the amount of time that the executable
specified by its first argument has taken to run since it was added to the executable map. It returns 1 if the
executable does not exist in the executable map.
<h3>%which_path</h3>





%which_path takes two arguments. The first is the name of the
executable to search for, the second is the colon-separated search path
within which to look for it. If an executable is found, it is printed,
otherwise an error is returned.






<h3>%which_return</h3>





%which_return takes one argument, the name of an executable in the
executable map. If the executable is found, then it prints the last
value returned by that executable, and then returns 0. If the
executable is not found, then it returns 1. If the executable name is
rwsh.argfunction or rwsh.mapped_argfunction, then it returns 2.
<h3>%which_test</h3>





%which_test takes one argument, the name of an executable to look up in
the executable map. If one is found it returns 0. Otherwise it returns
1. It does not print any text.<br>





<h3>%while</h3>








%while runs its arguments as a command, and for each time that they
return 0, it runs its argument function. &nbsp;Note: a loop of the form
"%while %return $X {...}" will either run its argument function
infinitely or not at all. &nbsp;$X is interpretted once, before the
statement is run, and however the argument function might change the
value of X, it cannot change the value that it used to have.
<h3>%var_add</h3>





%var_add takes two arguments, the name of a variable and an integer
value to add to this variable. The set of errors is VAR_ADD_ERROR,
VAR_NAN, VAR_RANGE, CONST_NAN, CONST_RANGE, SUM_RANGE.
<h3>%var_exists</h3>





%var_exists takes one argument, the name of a variable in the variable
map. If the variable is set then it returns 0. If the variable is not
set it returns 1.<br>





<h3>%version</h3>












%version prints out the version of rwsh that is currently running
<h3>%version_available</h3>











%version_available takes no arguments, and prints out a list of those that would return true if passed to %version_compatible.





<h3>%version_compatible</h3>











%version_compatible takes one argument, and returns 0 if that argument is an rwsh version number compatible with this one.
