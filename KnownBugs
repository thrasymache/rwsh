If a requested function does not exist, and rwsh.autofunction exceeds 
MAX_NESTING, then you will get both the excessive_nesting and 
executable_not_found errors.  You could make an argument that this is what 
should be done, after all, both errors occurred.  But then this should be the 
behavior when a function calls an executable, which causes rwsh.autofunction to exceed MAX_NESTING, but in this case, only the excessive_nesting error occurs.

%return must set errno to 0, because other function calls are causing errors
