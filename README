rwsh is a shell for Unix-like systems.  

Documentation can be found in the docs directory.  As it is still very much of 
a proof-of-concept, there is no install or configure script.  

No attempt has been made to keep it compatible with existing shells, or even 
their basic semantics.  So please read at least the "introduction and 
philosophy" document before assuming that you know what a command will do.
