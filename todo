Supporting selection stuff should be high priority
	e.g. file doesn't exist, previous selection, relative paths,
	multiple REs, better name that $SELECT, can cp with two arguments
plumber keeps track of the PIDs that it should be waiting for and updates the 
	correct status.
plumber accepts signals, so that if a child hangs, SIGINT will give you a shell
	to kill it with. Does this give you inconvenient job control?

%uname
%echo_error and then fix all of the error messages to use it. the point is that
	you don't normally want them redirected, so this is useful by itself
	you just need to redirect it to be able to test it
separate initializations - rwshrc selects which configuration scheme
	configuration scheme sources separate scripts for each fraction
	divide fractions based upon what people will want different
	(first different is netflix-rwsh: no $HOME/.rwshrc, different id)
make special netflix-rwsh stuff a separate config
